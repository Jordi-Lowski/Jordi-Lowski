I'm a dual student at Hitachi Rail diving deep into Embedded Systems. 
I'm set to earn my Bachelor's this September, and I'm excited to share my journey through public repositories showcasing my progress, experiments, and innovative project ideas.
Always curious and ready to learn, I enjoy blending theory with hands-on tech to create smart, real-world solutions.<br>
